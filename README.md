# NWMD: A model of the reaction of the population of the NYC area to a nuclear WMD event
## Version 2.0 Integrated agent groups and first reactions
### Developers: Annetta Burger, Bill Kennedy, Richard Jiang, Xiaoyi Yuan, Talha Oz, and Andrew Crooks

## Model Assumptions:
* 1. Note daycare locations are chosen from the home locations -- so the model does not show parents picking up kids in daycare close to their workplaces... we have not looked for data to show how many parents choose daycare close to home vs. work
