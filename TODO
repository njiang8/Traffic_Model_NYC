Big TODOs:

1. Create bin (Node and RdID) for agents traveling to work outside the commuter region
2. Change HashMaps to TreeMaps -- for ordering the maps -- needed for stopping and saving the simulation mid-run
-- note that treemaps cannot be used for GeomPlanarGraphEdges -- only native java types
3. Create an attribute class for the edges -- will replace hashmaps
